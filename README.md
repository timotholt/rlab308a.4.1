There are two versions of this lab.  The FETCH version and the AXIOS version.

You can switch betwen the two from the really ugly hyperlink at the top.

Code

====

The FETCH version is inside index.html and index.js

The AXIOS version is inside index-axios.html and index-axios.js



The Malaysian cat data that returns an empty array is handled in both versions.

Thanks!
